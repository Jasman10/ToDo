ToDo Application 


## Overview of the Application

The word “Todo” means to perform a work. The main role of the ToDO is to help us perfrom our daily activities swiftly and efficiently. This upcoming activities and tasks can also be monitored with the help of the application. This helps to fulfill our daily tasks without missing any particular tasks. This application targets a single user which helps to maintain privacy of information and the tasks that are to be done.

## Benefits of the ToDo application.
<li>•	This application is mobile based so easy to use.</li>
<li>•	Helps to keep tracks of the each and every activity.</li>
<li>•	Increases productivity as every task can be planned according to the date and time can be managed.</li>
<li>•	Keeps our information private as nothing is written in a hard form.</li>
<li>•	After finishing any task, the task will be mention as completed so helping improve in memory.</li>


## Application Development Tools

The tools that have been used to develop the application are listed as below:

## JDK
A Java Development Kit or JDK is a widely used software development environment package, which is used for any or all the software developed with Java as its platform. As it gives a rarely advantageous combination of properties like security, consistency, reliability and good processing speed, Java is chosen by most of the developers for creating a system application or a web application. JDK is an essential part for creating a functional environment for the Java development process.

## Android Studio (4.1.1)
Android is an operating system for mobiles and it is based on Linux kernel. It is primarily designed for smartphones and tablets. Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices. This means that developers only need to develop for Android, and their applications shall be able to run on the several devices that are powered by Android. It is an open-source OS, which means that its source code is available to the developers for free.

## Android Virtual Machine
A virtual machine is based on computer architectures to provide functionality of a computer. The Android Emulator simulates Android devices on our computer so that we can test our application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have each physical device. The emulator provides almost all of the capabilities of a real Android device. We can simulate incoming phone calls and text messages, specify the location of the device, simulate different network speeds, simulate rotation and other hardware sensors, access the Google Play Store, and much more. Testing our app on the emulator is in some ways faster and easier than doing so on a physical device. For example, we can transfer data faster to the emulator than to a device connected over USB.

## Java
Java is a simple and yet powerful object-oriented programming language and it is in many respects similar to C++. It was developed to provide a platform-independent programming language. Java is a platform neutral language, which means it is not tied to any particular hardware or operating system. It guarantees users to ‘write once, run anywhere’. Java language is supported by almost every operating system such as Sun Solaris, RedHat, Windows etc. Java has evolved from a simple language providing interactive dynamic content for web pages to a predominant enterprise-enabled programming language suitable for developing significant and critical applications.

## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Learn Object Oriented Concepts for Android: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model that allows users to create and organize Java applications on desktops. Writing object-oriented programs involves creating classes, objects and applications which are stand-alone executable programs that use those objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts. A few aspects of Object-Oriented development, it can help to make the best of our Android projects (Objects and Classes, Inheritance, Interface, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Polymorphism).

## PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION





## CONCLUSION
This is the basic functionality of the ToDo application to list out our daily tasks. This helps to keep our life managed efficiently and effective. All of our daily activities are listed and if any tasks are completed or is no more needed, it can be updated or deleted as well. This application makes our life simple and efficient.
